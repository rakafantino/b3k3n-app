 B3K3N-APP
</h2>

B3k3n app is an application that I built to fulfill the technical test of Deall Jobs.

**Note** I'm still having some trouble with the production.


## How to start the app

after you clone or download source code of the app from this github repo you can start the project with this command
to download all dependencies needed for this application to run:

```sh
npm install
```

or if you're using yarn use this command instead:

```sh
yarn
```

and after all dependencies downloaded you can run the app with this command :

```sh
npm run dev
```

or 

```sh
yarn dev
```

 it is a bit different command to run the app because i use [**vite**](https://vitejs.dev/) with [**react**](https://reactjs.org/) template instead using of using plain React.
